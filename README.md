## Overview

### The challenge
This is the first project I wrote with React.js. I think coding in React.js is more fun and organized. I've discovered that I can code faster than projects I've coded in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript in the past and that I can find what I want faster by navigating through folders. This had a very relaxing effect on me. I will continue to improve myself in React.js by working more.
Users should be able to:
- This project has been prepared in accordance with Mobil-Device and Desktop screen sizes.
- In addition, all interactive elements on the Page are actively working.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

In this project, I discovered that I could code faster using the React.js library.
I started coding by separating the sections into separate files as Components.


### Useful resources

- [React Animation](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#caveatsm) - This animation library helped me to make animation with React.Js very quickly and easily. I really like this pattern and will use it from now on..
- [Css Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Actually, I can use Css Flexbox very well, but sometimes when I can't remember the tag names, I can refresh my knowledge by quickly browsing this website.
